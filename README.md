# Sentinum--Sentiment-Analysis-using-Social-Media-Data

## Introduction

In this project, we are using the Sentiment Analysing algorithm to predict the emotional state of an individual based  on the data input from the person's social media posts and interactions. To perform this analysis, we use an interactive platform like the website or the mobile application and take the user authorized account name and process the data accordingly in our server and finally display the result of analysis performed i.e. the emotional state of the individual whose account name was provided. The main motive behind this project is to predict the mental health of a person during the lockdown period. When a person is locked-up in his home, he/she express his/her emotion through social media posts.
